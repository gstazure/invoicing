# Invoicing

*Like Xero, but shittier.*

Invoicing is an app for issuing invoices, track expenses and managing clients for all the sole traders of New Zealand. That are registered for GST. And can host a Rails app. And are able to configure Google OAuth.

## Installation

Do the usual like installing gems with bundler. Apart from that you need to install [wkhtmltopdf](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf) for PDF generation.

Mac OS run the following:

```
brew cask install wkhtmltopdf
```

Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf
```

### Google Authorization

Make yourself a project at [Google Console](https://cloud.google.com/console). In that project, go to the "APIs & auth" tab, then the "Credentials" tab. Create a new client ID of application type "Web application". Set the Authorized Redirect URI to `https://yoursite.com/google-callback`. You might want to put in `http://localhost:8080/google-callback` so you can test locally too.

### Configuration

After that you need to create a `config/database.yml`

```
